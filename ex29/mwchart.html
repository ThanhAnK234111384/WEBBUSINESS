            Doc-Centric Sales: Midwest Region
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Midwest region had another strong sales year with record-setting sales of both the M300-25 and M100-11 models. 
            The only disappointment was the lackluster sales of the M300-15 model, which started the year strong but
            tapered off into the fourth quarter. 
            All-in-all though, a very good year for the Midwest region.
