                Doc-Centric Sales: South Region
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight downturn. 
                Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest decline - 15% under sales two years ago. 
                The lone bright spot was the continuing
                strong sales of the M300-25 unit which increased as last year progressed.
